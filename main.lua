--[[
    Called whenever we change the dimensions of our window, as by dragging
    out its bottom corner, for example. In this case, we only need to worry
    about calling out to `push` to handle the resizing. Takes in a `w` and
    `h` variable representing width and height, respectively.
]]
function love.resize(w, h)
    push:resize(w, h)
end

--[[
    Called every frame, passing in `dt` since the last frame. `dt`
    is short for `deltaTime` and is measured in seconds. Multiplying
    this by any changes we wish to make in our game will allow our
    game to perform consistently across all hardware; otherwise, any
    changes we make will be applied as fast as possible and will vary
    across system hardware.
]]

    -- this time, we pass in dt to the state object we're currently using
    gStateMachine:update(dt)

    -- reset keys pressed

end

--[[
    A callback that processes key strokes as they happen, just the once.
    Does not account for keys that are held down, which is handled by a
    separate function (`love.keyboard.isDown`). Useful for when we want
    things to happen right away, just once, like when we want to quit.
]]
function love.keypressed(key)
    -- add to our table of keys pressed this frame
    love.keyboard.keysPressed[key] = true
end

--[[
    A custom function that will let us test for individual keystrokes outside
    of the default `love.keypressed` callback, since we can't call that logic
    elsewhere by default.
]]
function love.keyboard.wasPressed(key)
    if love.keyboard.keysPressed[key] then
        return true
    else
        return false

    Called each frame after update; is responsible simply for
    drawing all of our game objects and more to the screen.
]]
function love.draw()
    -- begin drawing with push, in our virtual resolution
    push:apply('start')

    -- background should be drawn regardless of state, scaled to fit our
    -- virtual resolution

        -- draw at coordinates 0, 0
        0, 0, 
        -- no rotation
        0,
        -- scale factors on X and Y axis so it fills the screen
        VIRTUAL_WIDTH / (backgroundWidth - 1), VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / (backgroundHeight - 1))
    
    -- use the state machine to defer rendering to the current state we're in
    
    gStateMachine:render()

    Represents the state of the game in which we are actively playing;
    player should control the paddle, with the ball actively bouncing between
    the bricks, walls, and the paddle. If the ball goes below the paddle, then
    the player should lose one point of health and be taken either to the Game
    Over screen if at 0 health or the Serve screen otherwise.

    We initialize what's in our PlayState via a state table that we pass between
    states as we go from playing to serving.
